\section{Objective of the Experiment}
%A brief statement on the main purpose of the experiment
During this lab, a 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional mapping of the magnetic field inside a Helmholtz coil was created in order to investigate the presence of a uniform field, running along the axial direction of the Helmholtz coil. 
\section{Theory of the Experiment}
%A short presentation of the concepts and formulas related to the experiment.

% How a helmholtz coil produces a uniform field
Recall for a straight current-carrying wire, circular magnetic field lines are generated around the wire in accordance with the curling right-hand rule. The Helmholtz coil contains two regions of circularly wound wires. (TO BE CONTINUED... how things cancel to make uniform)

\section{Equipment Utilized}
%List principal pieces of apparatus used by manufacturer, model and serial number. When it may be important, list principal specifications of certain pieces of equipment (e.g. the focal length of an optical system, etc.)

\section{Procedure}
% Describe in writing and provide a detailed sketch of the equipment used to measure the axial field in the coil.

%How hall effect probe works


%Describe the main steps in the experimental procedures. Be sure to include any precautions. Sufficient details should be given such that another student can follow and do the experiment.
Note that, per suggestion of the laboratory manual, the procedural steps of this experiment have been omitted. The discussion section provides sufficient detail on what actions were taken.
