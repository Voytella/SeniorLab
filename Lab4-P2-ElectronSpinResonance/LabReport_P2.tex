\qq The Lande factor, g_s, the gyromagnetic ratio of spin for the
electron was determined through the use of electron spin resonance and
Helmhotlz coils. The g-factor of a diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) sample was
obtained following the measurement of the frequency dependence of the
resonance field. The line width of the resonance signal was then caclulated.

\subsection{Frequency Dependence of Resonance Field}

\qq Voltage was compared to frequency to obtain a graphical
relationship of the frequency dependence of the resonance field. The
amplitude voltage was obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak voltage
from the oscilloscope and dividing it in half. The peak of
\ref{FrequencyDependece} is the specific resonance frequency for the field.
