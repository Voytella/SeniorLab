\qq The Lande factor, $g_s$, the gyromagnetic ratio of spin for the
electron was determined through the use of electron spin resonance and
Helmholtz coils. The g-factor of a diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) sample was
obtained following the measurement of the frequency dependence of the
resonance field. The line width of the resonance signal was then calculated.

\subsection{Frequency Dependence of Resonance Field}

\qq Voltage was compared to frequency to obtain a graphical
relationship of the frequency dependence of the resonance field. The
amplitude voltage was obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak voltage
from the oscilloscope and dividing it in half. The peak of
\ref{FrequencyDependece} is the specific resonance frequency for the field.

\subsection{Experimental Value of Gyromagnetic Ratio}
\qq The gyromagnetic ratio is calculated using the following equation, where $\nu$ is the frequency, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $B_0$ is the magnetic field strength.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_gs}
g_s = \frac{h \times \nu}{\mu_B \times B_0}
\end{equation} 

\qq The magnetic field used in calculating equation \ref{eq:exp_gs} must be calculated as well. It is determined from the measured current using equation \ref{eq:exp_B}, where $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \frac{Vs}{Am}$, the number of turns is $n=320$, and the radius of the coils is $r=6.8cm$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_B}
B_0 = \mu_0 \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) ^{3/2} \times \frac{n}{r} \times I
\end{equation}

\qq Rather than measuring the current directly, the current is calculated by measuring the voltage drop across a resistor, of which the resistance is also measured. This calculation is shown below in equation.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_I}
I = \frac{V}{R}
\end{equation}

\qq By substituting equation \ref{eq:exp_I} into \ref{eq:exp_B}, and then substituting equation \ref{eq:exp_B} into equation \ref{eq:exp_gs}, we arrive at an expression for the gyromagnetic ratio in terms of known constants and measured quantities. This final expression is shown in equation \ref{eq:exp_gs_combined}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_gs_combined}
g_s = \frac{h \times \nu}{\mu_B \times \left( \mu_0 \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) ^{3/2} \times \frac{n}{r} \times \frac{V}{R} \right) }
\end{equation}

\subsection{Propagating Uncertainty in Gyromagnetic Ratio}
\qq The error in the experimental value of the gyromagnetic ratio is determined by propagating uncertainty in equation \ref{eq:exp_gs_combined}.

\delta g_s &= \\
