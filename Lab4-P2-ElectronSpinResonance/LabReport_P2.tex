\qq The Lande factor, $g_s$, (or the gyromagnetic ratio of spin) for the
electron was determined through the use of electron spin resonance and
Helmholtz coils. The g-factor of a diphenyl-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) sample was
obtained following the measurement of the frequency dependence of the
resonance field. The line width of the resonance signal was then calculated.

\subsection{Frequency Dependence of Resonance Field}

\qq Voltage was compared to frequency to obtain a graphical
relationship for the frequency dependence of the resonance field. The
amplitude voltage was obtained by measuring the peak-to-peak voltage
from the oscilloscope and dividing it in half. The peak of
\ref{FrequencyDependece} is the specific resonance frequency for the
field. This value is a voltage amplitude of 1.01 V and a frequency of $4.18*10^7$ Hz. It is important to note that the electron spin resonance device
divides the frequency by a factor of a thousand, and thus the
Hewlett-Packard frequency counter displayed a corrected frequency. The
calculations require an uncorrected frequency, i.e. the counter's
frequency multiplied by one thousand.

\subsection{Propagation of Uncertainty in the Frequency Dependence of the Resonance Field}

\subsection{Experimental Value of Gyromagnetic Ratio}
\qq The gyromagnetic ratio is calculated using the following equation, where $\nu$ is the frequency, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $B_0$ is the magnetic field strength.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_gs}
g_s = \frac{h \times \nu}{\mu_B \times B_0}
\end{equation} 

\qq The magnetic field used in calculating equation \ref{eq:exp_gs} must be calculated as well. It is determined from the measured current using equation \ref{eq:exp_B}, where $\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \frac{Vs}{Am}$, the number of turns is $n=320$, and the radius of the coils is $r=6.8cm$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_B}
B_0 = \mu_0 \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) ^{3/2} \times \frac{n}{r} \times I
\end{equation}

\qq Rather than measuring the current directly, the current is calculated by measuring the voltage drop across a resistor, of which the resistance is also measured. This calculation is shown below in equation.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_I}
I = \frac{V}{R}
\end{equation}

\qq By substituting equation \ref{eq:exp_I} into \ref{eq:exp_B}, and then substituting equation \ref{eq:exp_B} into equation \ref{eq:exp_gs}, we arrive at an expression for the gyromagnetic ratio in terms of known constants and measured quantities. This final expression is shown in equation \ref{eq:exp_gs_combined}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp_gs_combined}
g_s = \frac{h \times \nu}{\mu_B \times \left( \mu_0 \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) ^{3/2} \times \frac{n}{r} \times \frac{V}{R} \right) }
\end{equation}

\subsection{Propagating Uncertainty in Gyromagnetic Ratio}
\qq The error in the experimental value of the gyromagnetic ratio is determined by propagating uncertainty in equation \ref{eq:exp_gs_combined}.

\begin{align*}
\delta g_s &= \\
\end{align*}

\subsection{Determining Line Width of Resonance Signal}
\qq $\delta$B_0 is representative of an absorption line, and is
obtained when the energy is measured at a fixed frequency as function
of the magnetic field. The line width $\delta$B_0 is used as an
expression of the uncertainty in the energy of the transition. This is
best represented by the equation $\delatE = g \times \mu_0 \times
\deltaB_0$. Using the uncertainty principle a relation is then found
for $\delta$B_0
\begin{align*}
\delta B_0 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \times g_J \times \mu_B \times T}
\end{align*}
where T is the lifetime of the level and g_J is the Land\acute{e}
factor. Experimentally $\delta$B_0 can be determined by the following equation:
\begin{align*}
\delta B_0 = B \times (\frac{\delta I}{I_{mod}})
\end{align*}
where $\delta$I is represented as $\frac{\delta U}{U_{mod}} \times  I_{mod} \times 2\sqrt{2}$. 

\begin{align*}
\delta I = \frac{\delta U}{U_{mod}} \times  I_{mod} \times 2\sqrt{2}
\delta I = \frac{0.55}{2} \times 0.156 \times 2\sqrt{2}
\delta I = 0.121
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\delta B_0 = B \times (\frac{\delta I}{I_{mod}})
\delta B_0 = (6.23\times10^{-4} \times (\frac{0.121}{0.156})
\delta B_0 = 4.85\times10^{-4} T
\delta B_0 = 4.85\times10^-1} mT
\end{align*}
