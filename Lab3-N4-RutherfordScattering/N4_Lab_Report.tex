\section{Objective of the Experiment}
%A brief statement on the main purpose of the experiment
\qq This experiment has several objectives the first of which is to
determine the differential cross-sectional area for the Rutherford
scattering. Experimenters will determine the countaing rate for the
alpha particles that have been scattered by the gold ( or aluminum )
foil as a function of the angle at which it is scattered. Once that
has been completed the next goal is to determine the corrected
counting rates, where the corrected rate is within respect to the
scattering distribution. The Rutherford scattering formula can then be
validated. Where the Rutherford scattering formula is as follows:
\begin{equation}
N(\theta) = N_0 \times c_F \times d_f \times [\frac{Z^2 \times
    e^4}{(8\pi \times \epsilon_0\times E_(\alpha)^2 \times
    sin^4(\frac{\theta}{2}}
\end{equation}

\section{Theory of the Experiment}
%A short presentation of the concepts and formulas related to the experiment. 

% How Rutherford scattering works (Coulomb repulsion etc)
\qq The goal is to measure the Rutherford scattering differential
cross-sectional area of an alpha particle against the nuclei of
gold. Rutherford scattering is where a charged particle undergoes an
elastic scattering due to a Coulomb force interaction. When the charge
alpha particles get close to the nucleus of gold, the difference in
charge forces the alpha particle to be repelled away from the gold
foil, i.e. they are scattered. The majority of these scattered
particles are scattered by angles of less than one degree. This means
that when back-scattering is ignored the number of scattered particles
drops off as the scattering angle increases. Back-scattering occurs at
large angles and is due to the extremely small size of the nucleus for
a gold atom. With this knowledge, one can determine the scattering
rate as a function of angle by determining the number of particles
that are scattered at a particular angle during a specified unit of
time.

% Description of set-up in prose
\qq The readout electronics system is set-up in series beginning at
the Rutherford scattering chamber's photodiode which is connected
directly to the preamplifier which connects to the amplifier then the
discriminator followed by the counter. The oscilloscope is essentially
connected in parallel, and was moved around in the set-up to check
signals at all points in the circuit design. The Rutherford scattering
chamber is also connected to the vacuum pump, which is utilized to
place the contents of the chamber under vacuum. Rutherford's chamber
is comprised of several components. The first component is the
americium 241 which is closely followed by the collimating slit and
gold ( or aluminum ) foil, the final component being the
photodiode. The photodiode detects the energy of the alpha particle
and converts it into an electrical signal, which is then transmitted
through the readout system.

% Production in gas chamber
\qq Alpha particles are produced from an $^{241}$Am source mounted inside the vacuum chamber on a rotating arm. Also mounted on this arm, directly in front of the source, is a collimating slit followed by a thin gold foil. With this configuration, one is able to strike the gold foil with a uniform, collimated beam of alpha particles. The chamber must be evacuated using an external vacuum pump, since alpha particles have a very short lifetime in air.

% Changing angle and measuring effect
\qq Alpha particles are scattered by Gold nuclei at varying angles, and the scattered particles are detected using a photodiode. In order to determine the dependence of the scattering rate on the incident angle, the rotating arm was moved through a range of $-30$ degrees to $30$ degrees using a knob on top of the vacuum chamber. Here, an angle of 0 degrees represents the arm oriented along the same line as the photodiode.

% Readout electronics
\qq The photodiode is connected via an external BNC port to a pre-amplifier that shapes the measurement signal. This is then connected to an amplifier, which amplifies the signal in accordance with a prescribed gain. This amplified signal is fed to a discriminator, which sets a minimum/threshold voltage in order to differentiate meaningful signals from electronic noise. Signals that meet this threshold are output in the form of a digital pulse. These pulses are fed to a counter module, which reads out the number of pulses over a given time interval.

% Acquisition time
The count rate decreases dramatically as the scattering angle increases. For this reason, the acquisition time was increased for larger angles in order to obtain sufficient statistics. The experimental scattering rate can be used to calculate the differential cross-section.

\subsection{Procedural Modifications}
\qq The manual dictates that the chamber be evacuated using the vacuum pump before conducting trials. However, it was determined that the seal of the vacuum chamber was not sufficient, and the detected rate of alpha particles would dramatically decrease after a few minutes. Therefore, in order to maintain a true vacuum throughout the course of data taking, the pump was continually operated throughout the experiment.
