\section{Procedure}

% Describe the main steps in the experimental procedures. Be sure to include any
% precautions. Sufficient details should be given such that another student can
% follow and do the experiment.

% Production in gas chamber
\qq Alpha particles are produced from an $^{241}$Am source mounted inside the vacuum chamber on a rotating arm. Also mounted on this arm, directly in front of the source, is a collimating slit followed by a thin gold foil. With this configuration, one is able to strike the gold foil with a uniform, collimated beam of alpha particles. The chamber must be evacuated using an external vacuum pump, since alpha particles have a very short lifetime in air.

% Changing angle and measuring effect
\qq Alpha particles are scattered by Gold nuclei at varying angles, and the scattered particles are detected using a photodiode. In order to determine the dependence of the scattering rate on the incident angle, the rotating arm was moved through a range of $-30$ degrees to $30$ degrees using a knob on top of the vacuum chamber. Here, an angle of 0 degrees represents the arm oriented along the same line as the photodiode.

% Readout electronics
\qq The photodiode is connected via an external BNC port to a pre-amplifier that shapes the measurement signal. This is then connected to an amplifier, which amplifies the signal in accordance with a prescribed gain. This amplified signal is fed to a discriminator, which sets a minimum/threshold voltage in order to differentiate meaningful signals from electronic noise. Signals that meet this threshold are output in the form of a digital pulse. These pulses are fed to a counter module, which reads out the number of pulses over a given time interval.

% Acquisition time
The count rate decreases dramatically as the scattering angle increases. For this reason, the acquisition time was increased for larger angles in order to obtain sufficient statistics. The experimental scattering rate can be used to calculate the differential cross-section.

\subsection{Procedural Modifications}
\qq The manual dictates that the chamber be evacuated using the vacuum pump before conducting trials. However, it was determined that the seal of the vacuum chamber was not sufficient, and the detected rate of alpha particles would dramatically decrease after a few minutes. Therefore, in order to maintain a true vacuum throughout the course of data taking, the pump was continually operated throughout the experiment.
