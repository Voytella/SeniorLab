% Physical meaning and derivation of differential cross section
\qq When an alpha particle with impact parameter \( b \) approaches a nucleus,
it is scattered at an angle \( \theta \). If the impact parameter is given an
infinitesimal range of [ \( b \), \( b + db \) ], the resulting scattering angle
then has a range of [ \( \theta - d\theta \), \( \theta \) ]; the impact
parameter and scattering angle are inversely proportional. 

\qq Because the alpha particle can be incident within a defined range at any
angle relative to the nucleus, a ring of possible incident locations is created
in front of the nucleus. This ring is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:crossSecRing}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=2.0];
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=1.8];
      \draw (0,0) -- (1,0) node[anchor=north] {\( b + db \)} -- (2,0);
      \draw (0,0) -- (0,-1.0) node[anchor=east] {\( b \)} -- (0,-1.8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The ring whose area represents the possible region in which alpha
    particles may be incident on a target nucleus.}
  \label{fig:crossSecRing}
\end{figure}

The area of this ring is found as the area of any ring is found:

\begin{align*}
  A &= \pi (b + db)^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi (b^2 + 2 b db + db^2) - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi b^2 + 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 \\
\end{align*}

Since \( db \) is infinitesimally small, it can be approximated to be
zero. Therefore, the area of the incident ring, \( \Delta \sigma \), is

\begin{equation*}
  \Delta \sigma = 2 \pi b db
\end{equation*}

\qq Since \( \Delta \sigma \) is the area of the full incident ring, an
infinitesimal angular portion of that ring, \( d\phi \), may be represented by
\( \Delta \sigma (\phi) = b db d\phi \). Additionally, because the impact
parameter \( b \) is related to the scattering angle \( \theta \), \( \Delta
\sigma \) is also a function of \( \theta \). Hence, 

\begin{equation*}
  \Delta \sigma (\theta, \phi) = b db d\phi
\end{equation*}

\qq Since the impact parameter \( b \) is directly proportional to the size of
the cross section and the scattering angle \( \theta \) is inversely
proportional to the impact parameter, the size of the cross section decreases as
the scattering angle increases. Therefore, the cross section experiences a
negative rate of change as \( \theta \) increases. Hence, 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma (\theta, \phi) = - d\sigma (\theta, \phi) 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dSigma}
