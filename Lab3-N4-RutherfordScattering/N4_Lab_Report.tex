\section{Objective of the Experiment}
%A brief statement on the main purpose of the experiment
\qq 

\section{Theory of the Experiment}
%A short presentation of the concepts and formulas related to the experiment. 

% How Rutherford scattering works (Coulomb repulsion etc)
\qq The goal is to measure the Rutherford Scattering differential
cross-sectional area of an alpha particle against the nuclei of
gold. Rutherford scattering is where a charged particle undergoes an
elastic scattering due to a Coulomb force interaction. When the charge
alpha particles get close to the nucleus of gold, the difference in
charge forces the alpha particle to be repelled away from the gold
foil, i.e. they are scattered. The majority of these scattered
particles are scattered by angles of less than one degree. This means
that when back-scattering is ignored the number of scattered particles
drops off as the scattering angle increases. Back-scattering occurs at
large angles and is due to the extremely small size of the nucleus for
a gold atom. With this knowledge, one can determine the scattering
rate as a function of angle by determining the number of particles
that are scattered at a particular angle during a specified unit of
time.
