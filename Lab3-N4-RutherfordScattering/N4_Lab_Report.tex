\section{Objective of the Experiment}
%A brief statement on the main purpose of the experiment
\qq During this experiment, the differential cross-section for a scattering
process will be determined. Researchers will measure the counting rate for alpha
particles scattered by a Gold or Aluminum foil as a function of the angle at
which it is scattered. Using this information, one can calculate a counting rate
corrected with respect to the scattering distribution. The following Rutherford
scattering formula can then be validated:
\begin{equation}
N(\theta) = N_0 \times c_F \times d_f \times 
            \frac {Z^2 \times e^4}
                  {
                  \left( 8\pi \times \epsilon_0\times E_{\alpha} \right) ^2 
                   \times  sin^4 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
                  }      
\end{equation}

\section{Theory of the Experiment}
%A short presentation of the concepts and formulas related to the experiment. 

% How Rutherford scattering works (Coulomb repulsion etc)
\qq Rutherford scattering describes the process in which charged particles
article undergo elastic scattering due to a Coulomb force interaction. When the
positively charged alpha particles approach the positively charged gold nuclei,
the like charges cause a repulsive force that deflects the alpha particles at
varying angles. This deflection/scattering angle depends on the distance of
closest approach between the alpha particles and nuclei, since the Coulomb force
is a function of distance. Because the gold atoms consist of mostly empty space,
the majority of alpha particles are sufficiently far away from the gold nuclei
that they experience minimal Coulomb repulsion and are only scattered at angles
of less than one degree. However, there are still some alpha particles that
approach the gold nuclei close enough to experience stronger Coulomb repulsion
and scattering at greater angles. If one were to observe the number of scattered
alpha particles as a function of the angle at which they are scattered, the
resultant distribution would show a large rate at small angles, but the
distribution would quickly drop off as the angle increases. Note, however, that
this distribution does not account for particles that are back-scattered,
meaning that they are close enough to the gold nuclei to be deflected backwards
towards the alpha source. Accounting for these measurements would show a spike
in the rate curve at an angle of 180 degrees, in what is otherwise a
monotonically decreasing distribution.

% Physical meaning and derivation of differential cross section
\qq When an alpha particle with impact parameter \( b \) approaches a nucleus,
it is scattered at an angle \( \theta \). If the impact parameter is given an
infinitesimal range of [ \( b \), \( b + db \) ], the resulting scattering angle
then has a range of [ \( \theta - d\theta \), \( \theta \) ]; the impact
parameter and scattering angle are inversely proportional. 

\qq Because the alpha particle can be incident within a defined range at any
angle relative to the nucleus, a ring of possible incident locations is created
in front of the nucleus. This ring is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:crossSecRing}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=2.0];
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=1.8];
      \draw (0,0) -- (1,0) node[anchor=north] {\( b + db \)} -- (2,0);
      \draw (0,0) -- (0,-1.0) node[anchor=east] {\( b \)} -- (0,-1.8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The ring whose area represents the possible region in which alpha
    particles may be incident on a target nucleus.}
  \label{fig:crossSecRing}
\end{figure}

The area of this ring is found as the area of any ring is found:

\begin{align*}
  A &= \pi (b + db)^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi (b^2 + 2 b db + db^2) - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi b^2 + 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 \\
\end{align*}

Since \( db \) is infinitesimally small, it can be approximated to be
zero. Therefore, the area of the incident ring, \( \Delta \sigma \), is

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma = 2 \pi b db
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:deltaSigma}

%\qq Since \( \Delta \sigma \) is the area of the full incident ring, an
%infinitesimal angular portion of that ring, \( d\phi \), may be represented by
%\( \Delta \sigma (\phi) = b db d\phi \). Additionally, because the impact
%parameter \( b \) is related to the scattering angle \( \theta \), \( \Delta
%\sigma \) is also a function of \( \theta \). Hence, 
%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \Delta \sigma (\theta, \phi) = b db d\phi
%\end{equation*}

\qq Since the impact parameter \( b \) is directly proportional to the size of
the cross section and the scattering angle \( \theta \) is inversely
proportional to the impact parameter, the size of the cross section decreases as
the scattering angle increases. Therefore, the cross section experiences a
negative rate of change as \( \theta \) increases. Hence, 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma (\theta) = - d\sigma (\theta) 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dSigma}

\qq The circumference of a circle is equal to \( 2 \pi r \), where \( r \) is
the radius of the circle. In the experiment, the radius of the ring onto which
the alpha particle is projected after it is scattered is \( R \sin{(\theta)} \),
where \( \theta \) is the scattering angle and \( R \), described in Figure
\ref{fig:alphaDist}, is the distance between the point at which the alpha
particle was scattered and the edge of the ring.

  \end{center}
  \caption{The path of the alpha particle as it is scattered by a nucleus. \( R
    \) is the path length between the nucleus and the ring of the solid
    angle.}
  \label{fig:alphaDist}
\end{figure}

\qq The outer circumference of this ring is \( 2 \pi R \sin{(\theta)} \). Since
the alpha particle is incident within a range whose minimum is \( \theta -
d\theta \), however, the ring has a thickness of \( R d\theta \). Since the
thickness of the ring is infinitesimal, the ring's area can be approximated to
be that of a rectangle. Therefore, the area of the ring is \( A = 2 \pi R
\sin{(\theta)} R d\theta \). 

\qq The solid angle of the scattered alpha particles at an angle \( \theta \)
is:

\begin{align*}
  \Delta \Omega &= \frac{A}{R^2} \\
                &= \frac{(2 \pi R \sin{(\theta)} R d\theta)}{R^2} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  d\Omega = 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dOmega}

\qq An expression for the differential cross section \( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}
(\theta) \) can be found by multiplying Equation \ref{eqn:dSigma} by Equation
\ref{eqn:dOmega} divided by itself.

\begin{align*}
  \Delta \sigma &=- \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) d\Omega \\ 
                &= - \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 2 \pi 
                  \sin{(\theta)} d\theta \\
\end{align*} 

from Equation \ref{eqn:deltaSigma}:

\begin{align*}
  - \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} d\theta &= 2 \pi b db
  \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = 
  - \frac{b}{\sin{(\theta)}} \frac{db}{d\theta} 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:diffCrossSecB}

Since it is known that \( b = \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E}
\text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \), it can be inserted into Equation
\ref{eqn:diffCrossSecB}. Furthermore, since \( b \) is a function of \( \theta
\), \( \frac{db}{d\theta} \) can also be found:

\begin{align*}
  b &= \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E} \text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
  \\
  \frac{db}{d\theta} &= \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E}
                       \left( - \frac{1}{2} \text{csc}^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
                       \right) \right) \\
  \frac{db}{d\theta} &= - \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \text{csc}^2 \left(
                       \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \\
\end{align*} 

\qq Now that \( b \) and \( db \) have been found, the full expression for the
differential cross section \( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \) can be determined:

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 
  &= - \frac{b}{\sin{(\theta)}} \frac{db}{d\theta} \\
  &= - \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E} \text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
    \right) \right)
    \frac{1}{\sin{(\theta)}} 
    \left( - \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \text{csc}^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
    \right) \right) \\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \right)^2
    \frac{\cos{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}{\sin{\left(
    \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}
    \frac{1}{\sin{(\theta)}}
    \frac{1}{\sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \right)^2
    \cos{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
    \frac{1}{\left( 2 \sin{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \cos{\left(
    \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \right)} 
    \frac{1}{\sin^3 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E}
  \right)^2 \frac{1}{\sin^4 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:diffCrossSec}

Equation \ref{eqn:diffCrossSec} is the equation for calculating the
theoretical differential cross-section. 

\qq The differential cross-section can also be found experimentally using a
found alpha particle scattering rate at a particular angle \( \theta \). First,
this relation must be constructed. The collimated beam of alpha particles begins
its journey with an incident rate of \( \frac{dN_0}{dt} \). This beam is then
incident on a thin foil with an atomic density of
\( n = \frac{\rho N_A d}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is the density of the foil
material, \( d \) is the thickness of the foil, and \( A \) is the atomic number
of the foil material. By being incident on the foil, the alpha particles are
exposed to a differential cross-section at the particular angle of
\( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) \). The alpha particles are scattered by the
nuclei across a solid angle \( \Delta \Omega = {A_{\text{detector}}}{r^2} \),
where \( A_{\text{detector}} \) is the area of the detector and \( r \) is the
distance between the foil and detector. Multiplying these factors together
results in the scattering rate of the alpha particles incident on a particular
foil at a particular angle: \( \frac{dN}{dt} (\theta) = \frac{dN_0}{dt} n
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) \Delta \Omega \). Since the scattering rate is
determined experimentally, the equation can be rearranged for the differential
cross-section:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = \frac{\frac{dN}{dt}
    (\theta)}{\frac{dN_0}{dt} n \Delta \Omega}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:expDiffCrossSec}

% Description of set-up in prose
\qq The readout electronics system is set-up in series beginning at
the Rutherford scattering chamber's photodiode which is connected
directly to the preamplifier which connects to the amplifier then the
discriminator followed by the counter. The oscilloscope is essentially
connected in parallel, and was moved around in the set-up to check
signals at all points in the circuit design. The Rutherford scattering
chamber is also connected to the vacuum pump, which is utilized to
place the contents of the chamber under vacuum. Rutherford's chamber
is comprised of several components. The first component is the
americium 241 which is closely followed by the collimating slit and
gold ( or aluminum ) foil, the final component being the
photodiode. The photodiode detects the energy of the alpha particle
and converts it into an electrical signal, which is then transmitted
through the readout system.

\section{Procedure}

% Describe the main steps in the experimental procedures. Be sure to include any
% precautions. Sufficient details should be given such that another student can
% follow and do the experiment.

% Production in gas chamber
\qq Alpha particles are produced from an $^{241}$Am source mounted inside the
vacuum chamber on a rotating arm. Also mounted on this arm, directly in front of
the source, is a collimating slit followed by a thin gold foil. With this
configuration, one is able to strike the gold foil with a uniform, collimated
beam of alpha particles. The chamber must be evacuated using an external vacuum
pump, since alpha particles have a very short lifetime in air.

% Changing angle and measuring effect
\qq Alpha particles are scattered by Gold nuclei at varying angles, and the
scattered particles are detected using a photodiode. In order to determine the
dependence of the scattering rate on the incident angle, the rotating arm was
moved through a range of $-30$ degrees to $30$ degrees using a knob on top of
the vacuum chamber. Here, an angle of 0 degrees represents the arm oriented
along the same line as the photodiode.

% Readout electronics
\qq The photodiode is connected via an external BNC port to a pre-amplifier that
shapes the measurement signal. This is then connected to an amplifier, which
amplifies the signal in accordance with a prescribed gain. This amplified signal
is fed to a discriminator, which sets a minimum/threshold voltage in order to
differentiate meaningful signals from electronic noise. Signals that meet this
threshold are output in the form of a digital pulse. These pulses are fed to a
counter module, which reads out the number of pulses over a given time interval.

% Acquisition time
The count rate decreases dramatically as the scattering angle increases. For
this reason, the acquisition time was increased for larger angles in order to
obtain sufficient statistics. The experimental scattering rate can be used to
calculate the differential cross-section.

\subsection{Procedural Modifications}
\qq The manual dictates that the chamber be evacuated using the vacuum pump
before conducting trials. However, it was determined that the seal of the vacuum
chamber was not sufficient, and the detected rate of alpha particles would
dramatically decrease after a few minutes. Therefore, in order to maintain a
true vacuum throughout the course of data taking, the pump was continually
operated throughout the experiment.  \qq

\section{Data Analysis}

%Calculate discrepancies from theory

% Direct counting rate as a function of angle (gold)
\qq While performing the experiment, the direct rate of scattered alpha
particles for a particular angle over a certain period of time was determined
from data straight from the counter. The direct rate, \( N_d (\theta) \), was
determined simply by dividing the mean number of counts by the number of seconds
the counter was allowed to run. For the gold foil at an angle of
\( \theta = \SI{15}{\degree} \) and a time of \( t = \SI{100}{\second} \), the
direct rate was:

\begin{align*}
  N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \frac{n_m}{t} \\
  N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \frac{(1.2)}{(100)} \\
  N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \num{0.012} \\
\end{align*}

Similar calculations were performed for the remaining angles, and the results of
those calculations, as well as the collected data, can be viewed in Figure
\ref{tab:scatRatesGold}.

% Corrected counting rate (wrt. distribution in space)
\qq The direct scattering rate \( N_d (\theta) \), however, is only relevant to
a two-dimensional plane scattering geometry, not the sought-after
three-dimensional geometry. Therefore, \( N_d (\theta) \) must be extrapolated
into three dimensions. In three dimensions, the alpha particles are scattered
across a solid angle \( d\Omega \) rather than across a two-dimensional
plane. In order to take into account the third dimension, the direct scattering
rate must be multiplied by the scattering angle. The result is the spacial
scattering rate \( N (\theta) \):

\begin{align*}
  N (\theta) &= d\Omega N_d (\theta) \\
  N (\theta) &= 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} N_d (\theta) \\
\end{align*} 

\qq For the gold foil, a direct scattering rate of \( N_d (\SI{15}{\degree} =
\num{0.012} \) yields a spacial scattering rate of:

\begin{align*}
  N (\SI{15}{\degree} &= 2 \pi \sin{(\SI{15}{\degree})} (\num{0.012}) \\
  N (\SI{15}{\degree} &= \num{0.0195} \\
\end{align*}

Similar calculations were performed for the remaining angles, and the results of
those calculations can be viewed in Figure \ref{tab:scatRatesGold}. The
uncertainties in the scattering rates were found by executing the Julia program
displayed in Section \ref{cod:uncertScatRateGold}.

% Theoretical results for rutherford formula
\qq The theoretical values for the scattering rates of the alpha particles
through the gold foil were determined using Rutherford's scattering formula, \(
N (\theta) = N_0 n \frac{Z^2 e^4}{(8 \pi \epsilon_0 E_{\alpha})^2 \sin^4
  \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \), where \( N_0 \) is the incident particle
rate, \( n \) is the nuclear density of the foil (found by multiplying the
foil material's atomic concentration by the foil's thickness), \( Z \) is the
nuclear number of the foil's material, \( E_{\alpha} \) is the energy of the
incident alpha particles, \( e \) is the elementary charge, and \( \epsilon_0 \)
is the dielectric constant. This formula is implemented on line 101 of the
general functions source file found in Section \ref{cod:genFuncs}. The results
of this calculation can be seen in Figure \ref{tab:scatRatesGold}.
