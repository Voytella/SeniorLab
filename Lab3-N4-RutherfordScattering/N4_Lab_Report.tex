\section{Objective of the Experiment}
%A brief statement on the main purpose of the experiment
\qq During this experiment, the differential cross-section for a scattering
process will be determined. Researchers will measure the counting rate for alpha
particles scattered by a Gold or Aluminum foil as a function of the angle at
which it is scattered. Using this information, one can calculate a counting rate
corrected with respect to the scattering distribution. The following Rutherford
scattering formula can then be validated:
\begin{equation}
N(\theta) = N_0 \times c_F \times d_f \times 
            \frac {Z^2 \times e^4}
                  {
                  \left( 8\pi \times \epsilon_0\times E_{\alpha} \right) ^2 
                   \times  sin^4 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
                  }      
\end{equation}

\section{Theory of the Experiment}
%A short presentation of the concepts and formulas related to the experiment. 

% How Rutherford scattering works (Coulomb repulsion etc)
\qq Rutherford scattering describes the process in which charged particles
article undergo elastic scattering due to a Coulomb force interaction. When the
positively charged alpha particles approach the positively charged gold nuclei,
the like charges cause a repulsive force that deflects the alpha particles at
varying angles. This deflection/scattering angle depends on the distance of
closest approach between the alpha particles and nuclei, since the Coulomb force
is a function of distance. Because the gold atoms consist of mostly empty space,
the majority of alpha particles are sufficiently far away from the gold nuclei
that they experience minimal Coulomb repulsion and are only scattered at angles
of less than one degree. However, there are still some alpha particles that
approach the gold nuclei close enough to experience stronger Coulomb repulsion
and scattering at greater angles. If one were to observe the number of scattered
alpha particles as a function of the angle at which they are scattered, the
resultant distribution would show a large rate at small angles, but the
distribution would quickly drop off as the angle increases. Note, however, that
this distribution does not account for particles that are back-scattered,
meaning that they are close enough to the gold nuclei to be deflected backwards
towards the alpha source. Accounting for these measurements would show a spike
in the rate curve at an angle of 180 degrees, in what is otherwise a
monotonically decreasing distribution.

% Physical meaning and derivation of differential cross section
\qq When an alpha particle with impact parameter \( b \) approaches a nucleus,
it is scattered at an angle \( \theta \). If the impact parameter is given an
infinitesimal range of [ \( b \), \( b + db \) ], the resulting scattering angle
then has a range of [ \( \theta - d\theta \), \( \theta \) ]; the impact
parameter and scattering angle are inversely proportional. 

\qq Because the alpha particle can be incident within a defined range at any
angle relative to the nucleus, a ring of possible incident locations is created
in front of the nucleus. This ring is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:crossSecRing}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=2.0];
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=1.8];
      \draw (0,0) -- (1,0) node[anchor=north] {\( b + db \)} -- (2,0);
      \draw (0,0) -- (0,-1.0) node[anchor=east] {\( b \)} -- (0,-1.8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The ring whose area represents the possible region in which alpha
    particles may be incident on a target nucleus.}
  \label{fig:crossSecRing}
\end{figure}

The area of this ring is found as the area of any ring is found:

\begin{align*}
  A &= \pi (b + db)^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi (b^2 + 2 b db + db^2) - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi b^2 + 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 \\
\end{align*}

Since \( db \) is infinitesimally small, it can be approximated to be
zero. Therefore, the area of the incident ring, \( \Delta \sigma \), is

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma = 2 \pi b db
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:deltaSigma}

%\qq Since \( \Delta \sigma \) is the area of the full incident ring, an
%infinitesimal angular portion of that ring, \( d\phi \), may be represented by
%\( \Delta \sigma (\phi) = b db d\phi \). Additionally, because the impact
%parameter \( b \) is related to the scattering angle \( \theta \), \( \Delta
%\sigma \) is also a function of \( \theta \). Hence, 
%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \Delta \sigma (\theta, \phi) = b db d\phi
%\end{equation*}

\qq Since the impact parameter \( b \) is directly proportional to the size of
the cross section and the scattering angle \( \theta \) is inversely
proportional to the impact parameter, the size of the cross section decreases as
the scattering angle increases. Therefore, the cross section experiences a
negative rate of change as \( \theta \) increases. Hence, 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma (\theta) = - d\sigma (\theta) 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dSigma}

\qq The circumference of a circle is equal to \( 2 \pi r \), where \( r \) is
the radius of the circle. In the experiment, the radius of the ring onto which
the alpha particle is projected after it is scattered is \( R \sin{(\theta)} \),
where \( \theta \) is the scattering angle and \( R \), described in Figure
\ref{fig:alphaDist}, is the distance between the point at which the alpha
particle was scattered and the edge of the ring.

  \caption{The path of the alpha particle as it is scattered by a nucleus. \( R
    \) is the path length between the nucleus and the ring of the solid
    angle.}
  \label{fig:alphaDist}
\end{figure}

\qq The outer circumference of this ring is \( 2 \pi R \sin{(\theta)} \). Since
the alpha particle is incident within a range whose minimum is \( \theta -
d\theta \), however, the ring has a thickness of \( R d\theta \). Since the
thickness of the ring is infinitesimal, the ring's area can be approximated to
be that of a rectangle. Therefore, the area of the ring is \( A = 2 \pi R
\sin{(\theta)} R d\theta \). 

\qq The solid angle of the scattered alpha particles at an angle \( \theta \)
is:

\begin{align*}
  \Delta \Omega &= \frac{A}{R^2} \\
                &= \frac{(2 \pi R \sin{(\theta)} R d\theta)}{R^2} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  d\Omega = 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dOmega}

\qq An expression for the differential cross section \( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}
(\theta) \) can be found by multiplying Equation \ref{eqn:dSigma} by Equation
\ref{eqn:dOmega} divided by itself.

\begin{align*}
  \Delta \sigma &=- \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) d\Omega \\ 
                &= - \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 2 \pi 
                  \sin{(\theta)} d\theta \\
\end{align*} 

From Equation \ref{eqn:deltaSigma}:

\begin{align*}
  - \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} d\theta &= 2 \pi b db
  \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = 
  - \frac{b}{\sin{(\theta)}} \frac{db}{d\theta} 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:diffCrossSecB}

Since it is known that \( b = \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E}
\text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \), it can be inserted into Equation
\ref{eqn:diffCrossSecB}. Furthermore, since \( b \) is a function of \( \theta
\), \( \frac{db}{d\theta} \) can also be found:

\begin{align*}
  b &= \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E} \text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
  \\
  \frac{db}{d\theta} &= \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E}
                       \left( - \frac{1}{2} \text{csc}^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
                       \right) \right) \\
  \frac{db}{d\theta} &= - \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \text{csc}^2 \left(
                       \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \\
\end{align*} 

\qq Now that \( b \) and \( db \) have been found, the full expression for the
differential cross section \( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \) can be determined:

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 
  &= - \frac{b}{\sin{(\theta)}} \frac{db}{d\theta} \\
  &= - \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E} \text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
    \right) \right)
    \frac{1}{\sin{(\theta)}} 
    \left( - \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \text{csc}^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
    \right) \right) \\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \right)^2
    \frac{\cos{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}{\sin{\left(
    \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}
    \frac{1}{\sin{(\theta)}}
    \frac{1}{\sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \right)^2
    \cos{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
    \frac{1}{\left( 2 \sin{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \cos{\left(
    \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \right)} 
    \frac{1}{\sin^3 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E}
  \right)^2 \frac{1}{\sin^4 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:diffCrossSec}

Equation \ref{eqn:diffCrossSec} is the equation for calculating the
theoretical differential cross-section. 

\qq The differential cross-section can also be found experimentally using a
found alpha particle scattering rate at a particular angle \( \theta \). First,
this relation must be constructed. The collimated beam of alpha particles begins
its journey with an incident rate of \( \frac{dN_0}{dt} \). This beam is then
incident on a thin foil with an atomic density of
\( n = \frac{\rho N_A d}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is the density of the foil
material, \( d \) is the thickness of the foil, and \( A \) is the atomic number
of the foil material. By being incident on the foil, the alpha particles are
exposed to a differential cross-section at the particular angle of
\( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) \). The alpha particles are scattered by the
nuclei across a solid angle \( \Delta \Omega = {A_{\text{detector}}}{r^2} \),
where \( A_{\text{detector}} \) is the area of the detector and \( r \) is the
distance between the foil and detector. Multiplying these factors together
results in the scattering rate of the alpha particles incident on a particular
foil at a particular angle: \( \frac{dN}{dt} (\theta) = \frac{dN_0}{dt} n
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) \Delta \Omega \). Since the scattering rate is
determined experimentally, the equation can be rearranged for the differential
cross-section:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = \frac{\frac{dN}{dt}
    (\theta)}{\frac{dN_0}{dt} n \Delta \Omega}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:expDiffCrossSec}

% Description of set-up in prose
\qq A series of readout electronics are used to process the signal from a photodiode detector, including: a pre-amplifier, an amplifier, a discriminator, and a counter.

The scattering chamber, where the Rutherford scattering process was performed, required evacuation with a vacuum pump. A rotating arm inside the chamber contains an Americium 241 source, a collimating slit, a Gold or Aluminum foil, and the photodiode. A photodiode detects the energy of the alpha particle and returns an electrical signal, which is then transmitted
through the aforementioned readout electronics. A more detailed description of the experimental process and implementation of this equipment can be found in the Procedure section of this report. The following list summarizes the pieces of equipment used and some relevant specifications:

\section{Procedure}

% Describe the main steps in the experimental procedures. Be sure to include any
% precautions. Sufficient details should be given such that another student can
% follow and do the experiment.

% Production in gas chamber
\qq Alpha particles are produced from an $^{241}$Am source mounted inside the
vacuum chamber on a rotating arm. Also mounted on this arm, directly in front of
the source, is a collimating slit followed by a thin gold foil. With this
configuration, one is able to strike the gold foil with a uniform, collimated
beam of alpha particles. The chamber must be evacuated using an external vacuum
pump, since alpha particles have a very short lifetime in air.

% Changing angle and measuring effect
\qq Alpha particles are scattered by Gold nuclei at varying angles, and the
scattered particles are detected using a photodiode. In order to determine the
dependence of the scattering rate on the incident angle, the rotating arm was
moved through a range of $-30$ degrees to $30$ degrees using a knob on top of
the vacuum chamber. Here, an angle of 0 degrees represents the arm oriented
along the same line as the photodiode. Because the Gold foil is 
incredibly thin, any air movement resulting from the utilization of the vacuum pump can potentially damage the foil. To mitigate this risk, the pump must be opened and closed slowly. The plane of the Gold foil is also oriented parallel to the valve's tube during this process so that the foil does not impede air flow and result in a tear of the foil.

% Readout electronics
\qq The photodiode is connected via an external BNC port to a pre-amplifier that
shapes the measurement signal. This is then connected to an amplifier, which
amplifies the signal in accordance with a prescribed gain. This amplified signal
is fed to a discriminator, which sets a minimum/threshold voltage in order to
differentiate meaningful signals from electronic noise. Signals that meet this
threshold are output in the form of a digital pulse. These pulses are fed to a
counter module, which reads out the number of pulses over a given time interval.

% Acquisition time
The count rate decreases dramatically as the scattering angle increases. For
this reason, the acquisition time was increased for larger angles in order to
obtain sufficient statistics. The experimental scattering rate can be used to
calculate the differential cross-section.

\subsection{Procedural Modifications}
\qq The manual dictates that the chamber be evacuated using the vacuum pump
before conducting trials. However, it was determined that the seal of the vacuum
chamber was not sufficient, and the detected rate of alpha particles would
dramatically decrease after a few minutes. Therefore, in order to maintain a
true vacuum throughout the course of data taking, the pump was continually
operated throughout the experiment.  \qq

\subsection{Visualization of Detection Chain}
Before inserting the Gold foil, the performance of the readout electronics was investigated by observing the output of each module on an oscilloscope. The signal from the photodiode was observed via the output of the pre-amplifier. As shown in figure \ref{preamp_amp}, the signal seen on the pre-amplifier is a falling pulse. The pre-amplifier signal is then fed to the amplifier, where it undergoes a prescribed gain and is inverted. These two pulses are shown together in figure \ref{preamp_amp}. Here, the gain is set to 10, so the ampltiude of the amplifier pulse in 10 times that of the pre-amplifier pulse.

\label{preamp_amp}
\end{figure}

The amplifier signal is fed to the discriminator module. If the amplifier signal has an amplitude greater than the threshold prescribed by the discriminator, then the discriminator outputs a digital pule. Figure \ref{preamp_discrim} shows this digital discriminator pulse displayed over the pre-amplifier pulse. Every pulse output by the discriminator corresponds to a count on the counter module.

\section{Data Analysis}

\subsection{Data Analysis I: Gold}
%Graphs, figures, and tables with captions

%Calculate discrepancies from theory

% Direct counting rate as a function of angle (gold)
\qq While performing the experiment, the direct rate of scattered alpha
particles for a particular angle over a certain period of time was determined
from data straight from the counter. The direct rate, \( N_d (\theta) \), was
determined simply by dividing the mean number of counts by the number of seconds
the counter was allowed to run. For the gold foil at an angle of
\( \theta = \SI{15}{\degree} \) and a time of \( t = \SI{100}{\second} \), the
direct rate was:

\begin{align*}
  N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \frac{n_m}{t} \\
  N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \frac{(1.2)}{(100)} \\
  N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \num{0.012} \\
\end{align*}

Similar calculations were performed for the remaining angles, and the results of
those calculations, as well as the collected data, can be viewed in Figure
\ref{tab:scatRatesGold}.

% Corrected counting rate (wrt. distribution in space)
\qq The direct scattering rate \( N_d (\theta) \), however, is only relevant to
a two-dimensional plane scattering geometry, not the sought-after
three-dimensional geometry. Therefore, \( N_d (\theta) \) must be extrapolated
into three dimensions. In three dimensions, the alpha particles are scattered
across a solid angle \( d\Omega \) rather than across a two-dimensional
plane. In order to take into account the third dimension, the direct scattering
rate must be multiplied by the scattering angle. The result is the spacial
scattering rate \( N (\theta) \):

\begin{align*}
  N (\theta) &= d\Omega N_d (\theta) \\
  N (\theta) &= 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} N_d (\theta) \\
\end{align*} 

\qq For the gold foil, a direct scattering rate of \( N_d (\SI{15}{\degree}) =
\num{0.012} \) yields a spacial scattering rate of:

\begin{align*}
  N (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= 2 \pi \sin{(\SI{15}{\degree})} (\num{0.012}) \\
  N (\SI{15}{\degree}) &= \num{0.0195} \\
\end{align*}

Similar calculations were performed for the remaining angles, and the results of
those calculations can be viewed in Figure \ref{tab:scatRatesGold}. The
uncertainties in the scattering rates were found by executing the Julia program
displayed in Section \ref{cod:uncertScatRateGold}.

% Experimental uncertainty (\delta)
\qq 

% Theoretical results for rutherford formula
\qq The theoretical values for the scattering rates of the alpha particles
through the gold foil were determined using Rutherford's scattering formula, \(
N (\theta) = N_0 n \frac{Z^2 e^4}{(8 \pi \epsilon_0 E_{\alpha})^2 \sin^4
  \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \), where \( N_0 \) is the incident particle
rate, \( n \) is the nuclear density of the foil (found by multiplying the
foil material's atomic concentration by the foil's thickness), \( Z \) is the
nuclear number of the foil's material, \( E_{\alpha} \) is the energy of the
incident alpha particles, \( e \) is the elementary charge, and \( \epsilon_0 \)
is the dielectric constant. This formula is implemented on line 101 of the
general functions source file found in Section \ref{cod:genFuncs}. The results
of this calculation can be seen in Figure \ref{tab:scatRatesGold}.

\subsection{Data Analysis II: Aluminum}
%Graphs, figures, and tables with captions

%Calculate discrepancies from theory

\qq The nuclear charge number of aluminum can be determined with \\
\( Z_{\text{Al}} = \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{Al}} (\theta) n_{\text{Al}}
    Z^2_{\text{Al}}}{N_{\text{Au}} (\theta) n_{\text{Au}}}} \), where
\( N_x (\theta) \) is the spacial scattering rate of alpha particles through a
foil of material \( x \) at an angle \( \theta \), \( n_x \) is the nuclear
density of the foil of material \( x \) (found by multiplying the foil
material's atomic concentration by the foil's thickness), and \( Z_x \) is the
nuclear number of material \( x \).

% Direct counting rate as a function of angle (gold)
\qq The direct counting rate and the spacial counting rate were calculated in
the same manner as for gold. The results of the experiment are displayed in
Figure \ref{tab:scatRatesAl}.

% Corrected counting rate (wrt. distribution in space)
\qq 

% Experimental results for rutherford formula
\qq Since the nuclear charge formula requires the scattering rates of both gold
and aluminum, the uncertainty for both measurements needed to be propagated
through it. The uncertainty for the scattering rates through gold was calculated
in the code shown in Section \ref{cod:uncertScatRateGold}, and the uncertainty
for the scattering rates through aluminum was calculated in the code shown in
Section \ref{cod:uncertScatRateAl}. The plots for those two calculations are
shown in Figures \ref{gph:expScatRatesGold} and \ref{gph:expScatRatesAl}
respectively. The experimental value for the nuclear number of aluminum was
calculated using the code shown in Section \ref{cod:uncertNucNumAl}, and it was
determined to be \( 62.7 \pm 3.216 \).

% Experimental uncertainty (\delta)
\qq 

% Theoretical results for rutherford formula
\qq The theoretical value of aluminum's nuclear charge was calculated in much
the same way as the experimental, except the theoretical values of the
scattering rates of the two foils were used. The theoretical values of the
scattering rates through both gold and aluminum were calculated using the code
shown in Sections \ref{cod:theoScatRateGold} and \ref{cod:theoScatRateAl}
respectively, and the data is represented graphically in Figures
\ref{gph:theoScatRateGold} and \ref{gph:theoScatRateAl}. The theoretical value
of the aluminum's nuclear charge was calculated using the code shown in Section
\ref{cod:theoNucNumAl}, and it's value was found to be 13.

\qq The differential cross-section is calculated using equation \ref{eq:expCrossSec}, shown below.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:expCrossSec}
 \frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega} = \frac
                                 {
								  \frac{dN}{dt} ( \theta )
								}
								{
								  \frac{dN_0}{dt} 
								  \times n
								  \times \Delta \Omega
                                 }
\end{equation}

The uncertainty in this differential cross-section measurement is propagated as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:expCrossSecUncert}
 \delta \left( \frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega} \right) 
   = \left\lvert \frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega} \right\rvert
   \sqrt
   {
        \left( \frac{\delta dN/dt}{dN/dt} \right) ^2
        +
        \left( \frac{\delta dN_0/dt}{dN_0/dt} \right) ^2
        +
        \left( \frac{\delta n}{n} \right) ^2
        +
        \left( \frac{\delta \Delta \Omega}{\Delta \Omega} \right) ^2
   }
\end{equation}
Note that in equation \ref{eq:expCrossSecUncert}, $\delta dN/dt$ and $\delta dN_0/dt$ are uncertainties in measured rates, $n$ is a given value that can be assumed to have no uncertainty, and $\delta \Delta \Omega$ is propagated from the distance to the photodiode and the height and width of the photodiode windows as follows:
\begin{align*}
\Delta \Omega &= \frac{A}{r^2} \\
              &= \frac{h \times w}{r^2} \\
              &= \frac{(4.12 \times 10^{-3}m) \times (2.22 \times 10^{-3}m)}{(1.97 \times 10^{-2} m)^2} \\
              &= 0.02 \text{ sterad}
\end{align*}
The uncertainties in the height, width, and distance were taken to be the standard deviation of a set of three measurements taken for each quantity.
\begin{align*}
 \delta \left( \Delta \Omega  \right) 
   &= | \Delta \Omega |
   \sqrt{ 
        \left( \frac{\delta h}{h} \right) ^2
        +
         \left( \frac{\delta w}{w} \right) ^2  
        + 2 \left( \frac{\delta r}{r} \right) ^2  
   } \\
   &= | 0.02 \text{ sterad} |
   \sqrt{ 
        \left( \frac{4.75 \times 10^{-4}}{4.12 \times 10^{-3}} \right) ^2
        +
         \left( \frac{7.64 \times 10^{-5}}{2.22 \times 10^{-3}} \right) ^2  
        + 2 \left( \frac{5.01 \times 10^{-4}}{1.97 \times 10^{-2}} \right) ^2  
   } \\
   &= 0.0025 \text{ sterad}
\end{align*}

The difference between experimental and theoretical cross-section values has an associated uncertainty. If the theoretical value is assumed to have no uncertainty, then the uncertainty associated with the difference will be that calculated in equation \ref{eq:expCrossSecUncert}.

\subsection{Source of Error}
% Describe sources of error, what type of error they are, and how they would affect measurements (what we did about them if possible)
%i.e. leaky vacuum would kill off alphas and systematically lower rate, but we kept pump on to mitigate this
%i.e. if threshold was too low we would have "false counts" which would systematically increase rate. Note that our baseline noise seemed to increase on last day without changing any other factors, an d we're not sure of the source but we thinking maybe bad cable connection, but we had to reassess the baseline noise and increase threshold. BUT signal-to-noise ration was still sufficiently high that increasing threshold should not run risk of cutting out "real counts"
% Thickness of foil could be nonuniform -> random error
% Other stuff
