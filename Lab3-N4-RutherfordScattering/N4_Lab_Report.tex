% Physical meaning and derivation of differential cross section
\qq When an alpha particle with impact parameter \( b \) approaches a nucleus,
it is scattered at an angle \( \theta \). If the impact parameter is given an
infinitesimal range of [ \( b \), \( b + db \) ], the resulting scattering angle
then has a range of [ \( \theta - d\theta \), \( \theta \) ]; the impact
parameter and scattering angle are inversely proportional. 

\qq Because the alpha particle can be incident within a defined range at any
angle relative to the nucleus, a ring of possible incident locations is created
in front of the nucleus. This ring is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:crossSecRing}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=2.0];
      \draw (0,0) circle [radius=1.8];
      \draw (0,0) -- (1,0) node[anchor=north] {\( b + db \)} -- (2,0);
      \draw (0,0) -- (0,-1.0) node[anchor=east] {\( b \)} -- (0,-1.8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The ring whose area represents the possible region in which alpha
    particles may be incident on a target nucleus.}
  \label{fig:crossSecRing}
\end{figure}

The area of this ring is found as the area of any ring is found:

\begin{align*}
  A &= \pi (b + db)^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi (b^2 + 2 b db + db^2) - \pi b^2 \\
    &= \pi b^2 + 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 - \pi b^2 \\
    &= 2 \pi b db + \pi db^2 \\
\end{align*}

Since \( db \) is infinitesimally small, it can be approximated to be
zero. Therefore, the area of the incident ring, \( \Delta \sigma \), is

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma = 2 \pi b db
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:deltaSigma}

%\qq Since \( \Delta \sigma \) is the area of the full incident ring, an
%infinitesimal angular portion of that ring, \( d\phi \), may be represented by
%\( \Delta \sigma (\phi) = b db d\phi \). Additionally, because the impact
%parameter \( b \) is related to the scattering angle \( \theta \), \( \Delta
%\sigma \) is also a function of \( \theta \). Hence, 
%
%\begin{equation*}
%  \Delta \sigma (\theta, \phi) = b db d\phi
%\end{equation*}

\qq Since the impact parameter \( b \) is directly proportional to the size of
the cross section and the scattering angle \( \theta \) is inversely
proportional to the impact parameter, the size of the cross section decreases as
the scattering angle increases. Therefore, the cross section experiences a
negative rate of change as \( \theta \) increases. Hence, 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta \sigma (\theta) = - d\sigma (\theta) 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dSigma}

\qq The circumference of a circle is equal to \( 2 \pi r \), where \( r \) is
the radius of the circle. In the experiment, the radius of the ring onto which
the alpha particle is projected after it is scattered is \( R \sin{(\theta)} \),
where \( \theta \) is the scattering angle and \( R \), described in Figure
\ref{fig:alphaDist}, is the distance between the point at which the alpha
particle was scattered and the edge of the ring.

\begin{figure}[H]

      \draw [dotted] (0,0) -- (0,2);

      % circle
      \draw (4,1.5) -- (4,-1.5);
      \draw [dotted] (4,1.5) -- (4,2);

      % particle path
      \draw [dashed] (-1,0.5) -- (-0.5,0.5); 
      \draw [dashed] (-0.5,0.5) arc[start angle=0, end angle=20] --
      (0.5,0.7) arc[start angle=20, end angle=60];
      \draw [dashed] (0.5,0.7) -- (4,1.5);
      \draw (2,1.4) node[rotate=15] {R};
      
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The path of the alpha particle as it is scattered by a nucleus. \( R
    \) is the path length between the nucleus and the ring of the solid
    angle.}
  \label{fig:alphaDist}
\end{figure}

\qq The outer circumference of this ring is \( 2 \pi R \sin{(\theta)} \). Since
the alpha particle is incident within a range whose minimum is \( \theta -
d\theta \), however, the ring has a thickness of \( R d\theta \). Since the
thickness of the ring is infinitesimal, the ring's area can be approximated to
be that of a rectangle. Therefore, the area of the ring is \( A = 2 \pi R
\sin{(\theta)} R d\theta \). 

\qq The solid angle of the scattered alpha particles at an angle \( \theta \)
is:

\begin{align*}
  \Delta \Omega &= \frac{A}{R^2} \\
                &= \frac{(2 \pi R \sin{(\theta)} R d\theta)}{R^2} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  d\Omega = 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:dOmega}

\qq An expression for the differential cross section \( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}
(\theta) \) can be found by multiplying Equation \ref{eqn:dSigma} by Equation
\ref{eqn:dOmega} divided by itself.

\begin{align*}
  \Delta \sigma &=- \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) d\Omega \\ 
                &= - \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 2 \pi 
                  \sin{(\theta)} d\theta \\
\end{align*} 

from Equation \ref{eqn:deltaSigma}:

\begin{align*}
  - \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 2 \pi \sin{(\theta)} d\theta &= 2 \pi b db
  \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = 
  - \frac{b}{\sin{(\theta)}} \frac{db}{d\theta} 
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:diffCrossSecB}

Since it is known that \( b = \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E}
\text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \), it can be inserted into Equation
\ref{eqn:diffCrossSecB}. Furthermore, since \( b \) is a function of \( \theta
\), \( \frac{db}{d\theta} \) can also be found:

\begin{align*}
  b &= \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E} \text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
  \\
  \frac{db}{d\theta} &= \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E}
                       \left( - \frac{1}{2} \text{csc}^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
                       \right) \right) \\
  \frac{db}{d\theta} &= - \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \text{csc}^2 \left(
                       \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \\
\end{align*} 

\qq Now that \( b \) and \( db \) have been found, the full expression for the
differential cross section \( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \) can be determined:

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) 
  &= - \frac{b}{\sin{(\theta)}} \frac{db}{d\theta} \\
  &= - \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{2 E} \text{cot} \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
    \right) \right)
    \frac{1}{\sin{(\theta)}} 
    \left( - \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \text{csc}^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2}
    \right) \right) \\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \right)^2
    \frac{\cos{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}{\sin{\left(
    \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}}
    \frac{1}{\sin{(\theta)}}
    \frac{1}{\sin^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
  &= 2 \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E} \right)^2
    \cos{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
    \frac{1}{\left( 2 \sin{\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \cos{\left(
    \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \right)} 
    \frac{1}{\sin^3 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = \left( \frac{Z Z^{\prime} e^2}{4 E}
  \right)^2 \frac{1}{\sin^4 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:diffCrossSec}

Equation \ref{eqn:diffCrossSec} is the equation for calculating the
theoretical differential cross-section. 

\qq The differential cross-section can also be found experimentally using a
found alpha particle scattering rate at a particular angle \( \theta \). First,
this relation must be constructed. The collimated beam of alpha particles begins
its journey with an incident rate of \( \frac{dN_0}{dt} \). This beam is then
incident on a thin foil with an atomic density of
\( n = \frac{\rho N_A d}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is the density of the foil
material, \( d \) is the thickness of the foil, and \( A \) is the atomic number
of the foil material. By being incident on the foil, the alpha particles are
exposed to a differential cross-section at the particular angle of
\( \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) \). The alpha particles are scattered by the
nuclei across a solid angle \( \Delta \Omega = {A_{\text{detector}}}{r^2} \),
where \( A_{\text{detector}} \) is the area of the detector and \( r \) is the
distance between the foil and detector. Multiplying these factors together
results in the scattering rate of the alpha particles incident on a particular
foil at a particular angle: \( \frac{dN}{dt} (\theta) = \frac{dN_0}{dt} n
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) \Delta \Omega \). Since the scattering rate is
determined experimentally, the equation can be rearranged for the differential
cross-section:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} (\theta) = \frac{\frac{dN}{dt}
    (\theta)}{\frac{dN_0}{dt} n \Delta \Omega}
\end{equation}
\label{eqn:expDiffCrossSec}
