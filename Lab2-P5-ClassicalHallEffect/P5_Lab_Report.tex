\section{Hall Effect in P-Germanium}

\subsection{Task 1}

\qq The Hall voltage dependence on the current was determined while
holding the magnetic field and the temperature at a constant. Please
note that the manual called for the constant magnetic field to be held
at 250 mT, we kept our constant magnetic field at 144 mT in order to
avoid reaching the maximum amperage on the coils. The corresponding
coil current was 4 A.

There is a linear relationship between the Hall Voltage and the
current, which is shown by the following equation, where $\alpha$ is
the proportionality constant:
\begin{align*}
U_H = \alpha * I
\end{align*}
The obtained proportionality constant was determined to be 0.943 V/A,
and the obtained R^2 value was 1.

\subsection{Task 2}

\qq The sample volatge as a function of the posistive magnetic field
induction was determined. The control current was held at a constant
30 mA. The change in resistance is to be compared to an increasing
field strength.

\qq The resultant graph shows a non-linear and quadratic change in the
resistance as a function of the increasing induced magnetic field
strength. The determined R^2 value was 0.978 representing a well-fit
data line.

In order to determine the Hall constant $\text{R}_\text{H}$, one can analyze the dependence of the Hall voltage on the applied field. This was done with a constant DC current applied across the Zn sample, with an associated random error due to the limited precision of the power supply. The error in the slope is obtained through linear regression, and the thickness prescribed by the sample specifications is assumed to have no error.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Slope, $b$ $\big[  \frac{\Omega \text{cm}}{\text{G}} \big] $ & $4.11 \times 10^{-13} \pm ERROR$ \topVspace \bottomVspace \\
\hline
Thickness, $d$ [m] & $2.5 \times 10^{-5} \pm 0$ \topVspace \bottomVspace \\
\hline
Sample Current, I [A] & $13.5 \pm 0.1$ \topVspace \bottomVspace \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:zinc_RH}
\captionof{table}{Measurements and calculations used to determine the experimental Hall constant of pure Zinc}
\end{center}

The Hall constant of Zinc is calculated as follows.
\begin{align*}
R_H &= \big( \frac{\mu_H}{B} \big) \, \frac{d}{I} \\
    &= (b) \, \frac{d}{I} \\
    &= (4.11 \times 10^{-13}) \, \frac{2.5 \times 10^{-5}}{13.5} \\
    &= 4.11 \times 10^{-11} \; \text{Vm/TA} \\
    &\equiv 4.11 \times 10^{-13} \; \Omega \text{cm/G} \\
\end{align*}

A theoretical value for the Hall constant of Zinc, given by the third edition of the AIP handbook, is $R_H = 3.30 \times 10^{-13} \; \Omega \text{cm/G}$.
