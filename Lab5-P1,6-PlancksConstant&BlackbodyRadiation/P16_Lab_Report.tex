\section{Results}

\qq For each of the four voltages, the relative intensity of light incident upon
the broad spectrum light sensor was plotted against the wavelength of the light
being measured by the sensor.

\qq First, \SI{3}{\volt} and \SI{0.388}{\ampere} were applied to the
bulb. Although no clear pattern can be readily discerned from the plot, Figure
\ref{gph:3volt}, at lower wavelengths, a clear peak of intensity occurs at
\( 939 \pm 1 \si{\nano\meter} \). This value is within the range of the
theoretical peak wavelength of \( 1734 \pm 1292 \si{\nano\meter} \). The
discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the peak
wavelength is calculated with
\( \Delta_{\lambda} = | \lambda_t - \lambda_e | \), where \( d \) is the
discrepancy, \( \lambda_t = 939 \pm 1 \si{\nano\meter} \) is the theoretical
value of the peak wavelength, and
\( \lambda_e = 1734 \pm 1292 \si{\nano\meter} \) is the experimental value of
the peak wavelength.

\begin{align*}
  \Delta_{\lambda} =& \left| (939) - (1734) \right| \\
  \Delta_{\lambda} =& 795 \si{\nano\meter} \\
\end{align*}

Since the standard deviation of the wavelengths at \SI{3}{\volt} is \(
\sigma_{\lambda} = \SI{306}{\nano\meter} \), the experimental value of \(
\lambda \) at \SI{3}{\volt} is:

\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\Delta_{\lambda}
\end{equation*}
